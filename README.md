apothecary enables users to simulate models of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics with an explicit focus on exploring the impact of therapeutic interventions. This is done using an age-structured SEIR model that also explicitly considers healthcare capacity and disease severity. 

## IMPORTANT NOTES

:warning: This code is released with no support and is not currently finished. Users outside Imperial College looking to run models of COVID-19 transmissiondynamics should **NOT** be using **apothecary** and instead use the actively maintained, currently functional package **squire** (available at: https://github.com/mrc-ide/squire) 

:warning: This model is in active development and so parameter names and behaviours, as well as output file formats, will change without notice.
